# LeetcodeSubmissionScraper
A Selenium based app that downloads all your submissions from leetcode.


This app requires Google Chrome to work, so be sure to install it.
After unzipping the file just run .exe. It will automatically download some additional modules which cannot be included because they depend on your Google Chrome version.
Then choose whether you want to download every accepted submission that exists or just the latest for each problem.
After your choice the browser will pop-up and you have to put in your credentials. 
After clicking "Sign in" just sit and relax while LeetcodeSubmissionScraper downloads your submissions.
!!!Please don't click anything in that browser while the script works.!!! 
Your submissions will be in a folder named "Solutions" next to the .exe file

If something went wrong please send me crash.log file and a screenshot of the error text in console.
